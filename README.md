## Languages - HTML CSS and JavaScript

I am currently working on a fullstack course and this is a project that I am doing to practice my skills. I am planning on making a simple portfolio that will show the current languages that I know.

I was able to include some javascript into this portfolio project to hopfully put a smile on your face.
